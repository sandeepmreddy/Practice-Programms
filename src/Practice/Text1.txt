Areas of improvement for My Manager:

Anger Management: It is essential to exercise greater control over emotions, especially when interacting with team members, to cultivate a more constructive and respectful communication environment. Displaying sudden anger can lead to disappointment and negatively impact team morale.

Agile Methodology Practices: Developing a foundational understanding of Agile practices fosters efficiency in collaborative and adaptive environments, aligning with modern project management standards. It is important to recognize that tasks planned within a two-week sprint should adhere to the sprint's timeline, and expecting their completion within a day or two undermines the purpose of Agile's iterative process.

Focus on Relevant Points: Staying focused on the topic at hand and addressing points that are directly related to the context will help improve the productivity and effectiveness of discussions.

Listening and Soft Skills: Active listening and refining interpersonal skills are key to enhancing collaboration and fostering a more positive working relationship with the team.

Openness to Different Approaches: When available, being receptive to others' viewpoints and flexible in adopting more effective approaches will contribute to better team outcomes and innovation.

Holistic Feedback Approach: It is critical not to generalize based on limited feedback. A broader perspective should be sought to ensure feedback is comprehensive and representative of the entire team's input.

Balanced Feedback: Rather than focusing solely on weaknesses, feedback should be balanced, recognizing both strengths and areas for improvement to encourage growth and development.
